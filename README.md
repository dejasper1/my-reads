# MyReads Project

This application was built with this [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) and is part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree curriculum.

In this project, React is utilized to create components to manage the user interface. The goal of the project is to create a virtual bookcase to store books and track what you're reading. Using the provided Books API, you can search for books and add them to a bookshelf. [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) was used to dynamically render pages.

## The Backend

This project included a backend server. Please note the backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
